# TzPivots

TzPivots is a custom MT4/MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is based on an earlier version by _Shimodax_. It can calculate pivot points, mid-pivots, Fibonacci levels, Camarilla pivots, and sweet spots.

The indicator is highly customizable - both in terms of its looks and in terms of the trading sessions used to calculate the levels.
